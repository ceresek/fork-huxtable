```{r}
#| tbl-cap: quarto cap
#| label: tbl-jams
library(huxtable)
caption(jams) <- "huxtable caption"
jams

# 1.4.549
# works with no label/caption at all
# works with only quarto caption, only huxtable caption, or both:
#   - quarto overrides huxtable
# works with only quarto label "jams". 
#   - But label cross-reference is not captured.
# fails with only quarto label "tbl-jams", whether or not there is a xref
# works with any huxtable label (jams/tbl-jams/tab:tbl-jams), 
#   - but xref is still not captured.
# works with quarto caption and label, so long as label is not tbl-
```
